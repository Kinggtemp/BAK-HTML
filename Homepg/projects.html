                        <h2> Genius Inspired Project</h2>
                        <p>This was my first ever attempt at building my own website. I wanted to create a page based on
                            'Genius', I figured if i can work out links, images and audio then I will have a strong
                            foundation to work from.
                            I am happy with this even tho it is not a perfect website or looks amazing, it is good for
                            me to experiment and learn more as time goes on.
                            I tried to add a lot of variety to show different skills and I guess for myself to learn different things.
                            I started on this webpage and decided to expand on this and create a navigation bar so I can
                            put all my projects in one place.</p>
