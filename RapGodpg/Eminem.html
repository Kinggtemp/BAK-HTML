            <h3>EMINEM</h3>
        </a>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; font: bold;"> “Rap God” is Eminem's braggadocious ode to himself and his career.
            Over its six-minute run-time, he references comic books, throws back to his old songs, and raps crazily
            fast.</p>

    <!-- The Song lyrics -->
    <pre>
     [Intro]

     "Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings"
     "But I'm only going to get this one chance" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
     "Something's wrong, I can feel it" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
     "Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
     If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
     And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances"
     "You are just what the doc ordered"
     
     [Chorus]

     I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
     All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
     Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
     They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
     
     [Verse 1]

     But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
     I got a laptop in my back pocket
     My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
     Got a fat knot from that rap profit
     Made a livin' and a killin' off it
     Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
     With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
     I'm an MC still as honest
     But as rude and as indecent as all hell
     Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
     This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
     You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
     With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
     Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
     And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
     I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
     Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
     Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
     How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
     Feel my wrath of attack
     Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
     It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
     While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce
     
     [Chorus]

     'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
     All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
     Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
     Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
     Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
     
     [Verse 2]
     Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
     Simply rage and youthful exuberance
     Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
     Hit the Earth like an asteroid
     Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
     MCs get taken to school with this music
     'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
     Now I lead a new school full of students
     Me? I'm a product of Rakim

     Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
     Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
     Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
     To meet Run-D.M.C., and induct them
     Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
     Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
     Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame 
     On the wall of shame
     You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
     Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
     Little gay-lookin' boy
     So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
     You're witnessin' a mass-occur
     Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
     "Oy vey, that boy's gay!"—that's all they say, lookin' boy
     You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
     And a "way to go" from your label every day, lookin' boy
     Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
     I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, lookin' boy
     I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
     Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
     Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
     Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
     
     
     [Chorus]

     I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
     All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
     The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
     Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
     Kneel before General Zod
     This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard
     
     [Verse 3]

     So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
     You rodent, I'm omnipotent
     Let off, then I'm reloadin'
     Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
     And I should not be woken
     I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
     But I got your mom deep-throatin'
     I'm out my Ramen Noodle
     We have nothin' in common, poodle
     I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
     It's me, my honesty's brutal
     But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
     For good at least once in a while
     So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
     To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
     But I gotta keep a few punchlines
     Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
     Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
     I know there was a time where once I
     Was king of the underground
     But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
     So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
     Appeal with the skin color of mine
     You get too big and here they come tryin'
     To censor you like that one line
     I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
     Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
     Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
     See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
     Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
     You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
     And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
     You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
     You write normal? Fuck being normal!
     And I just bought a new raygun from the future
     Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
     'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
     Singin' to a man while he played piano
     Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
     So Ray J went straight to the radio station
     The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
     Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
     Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
     What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
     
     Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
     I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
     How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
     Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
     For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
     'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
     I make elevating music, you make elevator music
     "Oh, he's too mainstream."
     Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
     "It's not hip-hop, it's pop,"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
     With rock, shock rap with Doc
     Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
     "I don't know how to make songs like that
     I don't know what words to use."
     Let me know when it occurs to you
     While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
     It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
     How many verses I gotta murder to
     Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
     Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
     But look at the accolades these skills brung me
     Full of myself, but still hungry
     I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
     And I'm a million leagues above you
     Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
     I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
     I'ma sleep in the front seat
     Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
     But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
     Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
     They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
     But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
     I have, then you may be a little patient
     And more sympathetic to the situation
     And understand the discrimination
     But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
     But if I can't batter the women
     How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
     Don't mistake him for Satan
     It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
     To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
     Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
     Why be a king when you can be a god?
